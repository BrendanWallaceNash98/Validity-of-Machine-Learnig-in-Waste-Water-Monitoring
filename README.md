# Validity-of-Queensland-Wastewater-Surveillance-Program-Methodology

31/05/2021

This was my first ever coding assignment, which involved me preforming data analysis on COVID-19 samples in Queensland State Government Wastewater samples. The analysis was conducted to find patterns in the areas that report higher levels of COVID-19 in wastewater samples and then critically analyses the effects of using a machine learning method to classify potential at risks areas for COVID-19 outbreaks. 

Assignment 2 final containes the final report and visualisation of data analysis.
